If you\ndo not understand what it means, please leave it as is.\nNote that when working with temporary queues where the subscription request\ncreates the\nunderlying queue, mssages might be missed during reconnect. This issue is not specific\nto this library but the way STOMP brokers are designed to work.\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                                    Default value\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        queueName\n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        headers\n                                                        \n                                                                    StompHeaders\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                {}\n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                Returns :     Observable\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Public\n                            waitForReceipt\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                            \n                        waitForReceipt(receiptId: string, callback: (frame: Frame) => void)\n                    \n                \n\n\n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in consolidated/ng2-stompjs/src/stomp-r.service.ts:215\n                            \n                        \n\n\n                \n                    \n                            STOMP brokers may carry out operation asynchronously and allow requesting for acknowledgement.\nTo request an acknowledgement, a receipt header needs to be sent with the actual request.\nThe value (say receipt-id) for this header needs to be unique for each use.
