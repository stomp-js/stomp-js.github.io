Callback, invoked on before a connection connection to the STOMP broker.\nYou can change configuration of the rxStomp, which will impact the immediate connect.\nIt is valid to call RxStomp#decativate in this callback.\nAs of version 0.1.1, this callback can be\nasync\n(i.e., it can return a\nPromise).\nIn that case connect will be called only after the Promise is resolved.\nThis can be used to reliably fetch credentials, access token etc. from some other service\nin an asynchronous way.\nAs of 0.3.5, this callback will receive [RxStomp](@link RxStomp) as parameter.\nMaps to:
