Refer to your STOMP broker documentation for types\nand naming of destinations.\nSTOMP protocol specifies and suggests some headers and also allows broker specific headers.\nbody must be String.\nYou will need to covert the payload to string in case it is not string (e.g. JSON).\nTo send a binary message body use binaryBody parameter. It should be a\nUint8Array.\nSometimes brokers may not support binary frames out of the box.\nPlease check your broker documentation.\ncontent-length header is automatically added to the STOMP Frame sent to the broker.\nSet skipContentLengthHeader to indicate that content-length header should not be added.\nFor binary messages content-length header is always added.\nCaution: The broker will, most likely, report an error and disconnect if message body has NULL octet(s)\nand content-length header is missing.\nThe message will get locally queued if the STOMP broker is not connected.

Typically a sequence, a UUID, a\nrandom number or a combination may be used.\nA complaint broker will send a RECEIPT frame when an operation has actually been completed.\nThe operation needs to be matched based in the value of the receipt-id.\nThis method allow watching for a receipt and invoke the callback\nwhen corresponding receipt has been received.\nThe actual Frame\nwill be passed as parameter to the callback.\nExample:\n       // Publishing with acknowledgement\n       let receiptId = randomText();\n\n       rxStomp.watchForReceipt(receiptId, function() {\n         // Will be called after server acknowledges\n       });\n       rxStomp.publish({destination: '/topic/special', headers: {receipt: receiptId}, body: msg});Maps to: Client#watchForReceipt\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    receiptId\n                                    \n                                                string\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                    callback\n                                    \n                                                function\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n    \n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                            Public\n                        state\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         BehaviorSubject\n\n                    \n                \n                        \n                            \n                                Inherited from         StompRService\n\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                                Defined in         StompRService:40\n\n                        \n                    \n\n            \n                \n                    State of the STOMPService\nIt is a BehaviorSubject and will emit current status immediately.
