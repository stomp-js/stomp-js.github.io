It should be a\nUint8Array.\nSometimes brokers may not support binary frames out of the box.\nPlease check your broker documentation.\ncontent-length header is automatically added to the STOMP Frame sent to the broker.\nSet skipContentLengthHeader to indicate that content-length header should not be added.\nFor binary messages content-length header is always added.\nCaution: The broker will, most likely, report an error and disconnect if message body has NULL octet(s)\nand content-length header is missing.\nSee: publishParams\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", headers: {priority: 9}, body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n   *\n   *        // Only destination is mandatory parameter\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n   *\n   *        // Skip content-length header in the frame to the broker\n   *        rxStomp.publish({\"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\", skipContentLengthHeader: true});\n   *\n   *        var binaryData = generateBinaryData(); // This need to be of type Uint8Array\n   *        // setting content-type header is not mandatory, however a good practice\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: '/topic/special', binaryBody: binaryData,\n   *                         headers: {'content-type': 'application/octet-stream'}});\n   *The message will get locally queued if the STOMP broker is not connected.

Typically a sequence, a UUID, a\nrandom number or a combination may be used.\nA complaint broker will send a RECEIPT frame when an operation has actually been completed.\nThe operation needs to be matched based in the value of the receipt-id.\nThis method allow watching for a receipt and invoke the callback\nwhen corresponding receipt has been received.\nThe actual Frame\nwill be passed as parameter to the callback.\nExample:\n   *        // Publishing with acknowledgement\n   *        let receiptId = randomText();\n   *\n   *        rxStomp.watchForReceipt(receiptId, function() {\n   *          // Will be called after server acknowledges\n   *        });\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: '/topic/special', headers: {receipt: receiptId}, body: msg});\n   *Maps to: Client#watchForReceipt\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        receiptId\n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        callback\n                                                        \n                                                                    function\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n\n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                Returns :     void\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    \n        Accessors\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        stompClient\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        getstompClient()\n                    \n                \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in consolidated/rx-stomp/src/rx-stomp.ts:116\n                                \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                                Instance of actual\n@stomp/stompjs\nClient.\nBe careful in calling methods on it directly -
