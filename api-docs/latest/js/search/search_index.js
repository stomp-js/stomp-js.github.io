Refer to your STOMP broker documentation for types\nand naming of destinations.\nSTOMP protocol specifies and suggests some headers and also allows broker specific headers.\nbody must be String.\nYou will need to covert the payload to string in case it is not string (e.g. JSON).\nTo send a binary message body use binaryBody parameter. It should be a\nUint8Array.\nSometimes brokers may not support binary frames out of the box.\nPlease check your broker documentation.\ncontent-length header is automatically added to the STOMP Frame sent to the broker.\nSet skipContentLengthHeader to indicate that content-length header should not be added.\nFor binary messages content-length header is always added.\nCaution: The broker will, most likely, report an error and disconnect if message body has NULL octet(s)\nand content-length header is missing.\nThe message will get locally queued if the STOMP broker is not connected. It will attempt to\npublish queued messages as soon as the broker gets connected.\nIf you do not want that behavior,\nplease set retryIfDisconnected to false\nin the parameters.\nWhen false, this function will raise an error if message could not be sent immediately.\nMaps to: Client#publish\nSee: IRxStompPublishParams and IPublishParams\n```javascript\n\nrxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", headers: {priority: 9}, body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n\n// Only destination is mandatory parameter\nrxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n\n// Skip content-length header in the frame to the broker\nrxStomp.publish({\"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\", skipContentLengthHeader: true});\n\nvar binaryData = generateBinaryData(); // This need to be of type Uint8Array\n// setting content-type header is not mandatory, however a good practice\nrxStomp.publish({destination: '/topic/special', binaryBody: binaryData,\nheaders: {'content-type': 'application/octet-stream'}});\n```\n\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    parameters\n                                    \n                                                IRxStompPublishParams\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Public\n                            watch\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                    watch(destination: string, headers: StompHeaders)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in consolidated/rx-stomp/src/rx-stomp.ts:440\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    It will subscribe to server message queues\nThis method can be safely called even if the STOMP broker is not connected.\nIf the underlying STOMP connection drops and reconnects, it will resubscribe automatically.\nNote that messages might be missed during reconnect.

Refer to your STOMP broker documentation for types\nand naming of destinations.\nSTOMP protocol specifies and suggests some headers and also allows broker specific headers.\nbody must be String.\nYou will need to covert the payload to string in case it is not string (e.g. JSON).\nTo send a binary message body use binaryBody parameter. It should be a\nUint8Array.\nSometimes brokers may not support binary frames out of the box.\nPlease check your broker documentation.\ncontent-length header is automatically added to the STOMP Frame sent to the broker.\nSet skipContentLengthHeader to indicate that content-length header should not be added.\nFor binary messages content-length header is always added.\nCaution: The broker will, most likely, report an error and disconnect if message body has NULL octet(s)\nand content-length header is missing.\nThe message will get locally queued if the STOMP broker is not connected. It will attempt to\npublish queued messages as soon as the broker gets connected.\nIf you do not want that behavior,\nplease set retryIfDisconnected to false\nin the parameters.\nWhen false, this function will raise an error if message could not be sent immediately.\nMaps to: Client#publish\nSee: IRxStompPublishParams and IPublishParams\n```javascript\n\nrxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", headers: {priority: 9}, body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n\n// Only destination is mandatory parameter\nrxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n\n// Skip content-length header in the frame to the broker\nrxStomp.publish({\"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\", skipContentLengthHeader: true});\n\nvar binaryData = generateBinaryData(); // This need to be of type Uint8Array\n// setting content-type header is not mandatory, however a good practice\nrxStomp.publish({destination: '/topic/special', binaryBody: binaryData,\nheaders: {'content-type': 'application/octet-stream'}});\n```\n\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    parameters\n                                    \n                                                IRxStompPublishParams\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Public\n                            watch\n                        \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                    watch(destination: string, headers: StompHeaders)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Inherited from         RxStomp\n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                        Defined in         RxStomp:440\n\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    It will subscribe to server message queues\nThis method can be safely called even if the STOMP broker is not connected.\nIf the underlying STOMP connection drops and reconnects, it will resubscribe automatically.\nNote that messages might be missed during reconnect.
