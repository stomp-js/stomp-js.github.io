reliably fetch credentials, access token etc. from some other service\nin an asynchronous way.\nAs of 0.3.5, this callback will receive [RxStomp](@link RxStomp) as parameter.\nMaps to:

It will attempt to\npublish queued messages as soon as the broker gets connected.\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                                    Default value\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        queueName\n                                                        \n                                                                    string | publishParams\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        message\n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            Yes\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        headers\n                                                        \n                                                                    StompHeaders\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                {}\n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                Returns :     void\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Public\n                            subscribe\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                            \n                        subscribe(queueName: string, headers: StompHeaders)\n                    \n                \n\n\n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in consolidated/ng2-stompjs/src/stomp-r.service.ts:183\n                            \n                        \n\n\n                \n                    \n                            It will subscribe to server message queues\nThis method can be safely called even if the STOMP broker is not connected.\nIf the underlying STOMP connection drops and reconnects, it will resubscribe automatically.\nIf a header field 'ack' is not explicitly passed, 'ack' will be set to 'auto'. If you\ndo not understand what it means, please leave it as is.\nNote that when working with temporary queues where the subscription request\ncreates the\nunderlying queue, mssages might be missed during reconnect.

created using this function is configured and activated.\nThis provides the simplest mechanism to define RxStompService for Dependency Injection.\nSee: /guide/ng2-stompjs/2018/11/04/ng2-stomp-with-angular7.html\nfor a step-by-step guide.\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n
