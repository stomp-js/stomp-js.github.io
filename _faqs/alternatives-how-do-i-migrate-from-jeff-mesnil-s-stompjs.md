Please see [upgrading stompjs](/guide/stompjs/2018/09/08/upgrading-stompjs.html)
guide.

API of v4 of this library is backwards compatible with original stompjs.
In all likelihood your working code would work under compatibility mode of
v5 of this library.

To use newer features like automatic reconnection, 100% compliance with STOMP
standards, and binary payloads, you would need to upgrade to newer syntax.
