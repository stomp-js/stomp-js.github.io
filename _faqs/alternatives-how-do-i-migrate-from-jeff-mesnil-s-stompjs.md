Please see [upgrading stompjs](/guide/stompjs/upgrading-stompjs.html)
guide.

The v4 of this library is backwards compatible with the original stompjs.
In all likelihoods your working code would work under compatibility mode of
v5.

To use newer features like automatic reconnection, compliance with STOMP
standards, and binary payloads, you would need to upgrade to newer syntax.
