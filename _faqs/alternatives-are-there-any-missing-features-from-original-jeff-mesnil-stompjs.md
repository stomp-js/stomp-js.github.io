question: "Are there any missing features from Jeff Mesnil's stompjs?"

The Jeff Mesnil's stompjs supports STOMP over TCP when used in NodeJS environment.
Other than this, there are no known missing functionality.
If you intend to use this feature, please raise an issue.

The Jeff Mesnil's stompjs does not support the STOMP protocol strictly
while `@stomp/stompjs` implements the protocol strictly and completely.
This might, in some cases, give behavioral differences.
If you facing any such issues please raise an issue.
