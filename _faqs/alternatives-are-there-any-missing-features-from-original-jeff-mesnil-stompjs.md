question: "Are there any missing features from Jeff Mesnil's stompjs?"

Jeff Mesnil's stompjs supports STOMP over TCP when used in the NodeJS environment.
Other than this, there is no known missing functionality.
If you intend to use this feature, please raise an issue.

Jeff Mesnil's stompjs is not fully compliant to STOMP protocol.
The `@stomp/stompjs` strictly adheres the protocol.
This might, in some cases, give behavioral differences.
If you are facing any such issues, please raise an issue.
