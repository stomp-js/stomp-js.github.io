Angular makes heavy use of [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS). So using `rx-stomp` should feel natural with Angular.

There is a tutorial for using `rx-stomp` with Angular. Please see [guides](/#getting-started).

Having said all of these, you can use any of the variants.
Developers have reported successfully using `stompjs` directly with Angular.
