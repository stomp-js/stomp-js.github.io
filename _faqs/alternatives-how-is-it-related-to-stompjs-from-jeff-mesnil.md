[stompjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stompjs)
from [Jeff Mesnil](http://jmesnil.net/) was one of the first STOMP implementations for JavaScript.
It has not been maintained since 2016. `@stomp/stompjs` started as a maintained fork.

`@stomp/stompjs` v4 enhanced the original API and remained compatible.
From v5 onward, `@stomp/stompjs` was rewritten in TypeScript and offers a modern API while
retaining a compatibility mode.
