[stompjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stompjs) 
from [Jeff Mesnil](http://jmesnil.net/) has been the most important
STOMP implementations for JavaScript.
However the original author has no longer been maintaining it since 2016.
`@stomp/stompjs` started as a maintained fork.
 
`@stomp/stompjs` v4 remained an enhanced version of 
[stompjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stompjs) 
from [Jeff Mesnil](http://jmesnil.net/).

Version 5 of `@stomp/stompjs` has been bottom up rewritten in TypeScript.
This version supports the older API in compatibility mode.
