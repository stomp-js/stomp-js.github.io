The largest number of issues reported are related to React Native. These are platform/runtime limitations or environment problems â€” not bugs in this library.

Please read and follow the React Native guide before reporting issues:

This library requires specific workarounds to function correctly with React Native; the guide documents those steps. If problems persist after following the guide, include your RN version, platform (iOS/Android), relevant configuration, and logs when opening an issue.
