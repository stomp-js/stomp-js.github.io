question: "Are there any missing features from Jeff Mesnil's stompjs?"
group: Jeff Mesnil's stompjs

The Jeff Mesnil's stompjs supports STOMP over TCP when used in NodeJS
environment.
This is not supported by these libraries.
If you intend to use this feature, please raise a issue.

The Jeff Mesnil's stompjs does not support the STOMP protocol strictly
while `@stomp/stompjs` implements the protocol strictly and completely.
This might, some cases, give behavioral differences.
If you facing any such issues please raise an issue.
