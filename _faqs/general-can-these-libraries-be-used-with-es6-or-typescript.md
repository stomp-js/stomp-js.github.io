Yes.

These libraries are released as [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd).
This should allow these modules to be used as JavaScript on web page as well as
from variety of module systems.

All these libraries have been developed in TypeScript and type definition
files are included in releases.

In the bundle, ESM5 and ESM6 variants are also included,
which can be used as alternatives.
