question: 'Can these libraries be used with ES6 or Typescript?'

Yes.

These libraries are distributed as JavaScript ES Modules by default and can be imported with `import`.

All libraries are developed in TypeScript and include type definitions.

A UMD bundle is also provided for direct use via a `<script>` tag in browsers.
