# Navigating through the API docs

The API docs cover three libraries:

- @stomp/stompjs
- @stomp/rx-stomp - builds over @stomp/stompjs

The documentation for classes also indicates which library each of the classes
 belongs. See the [guides](/) for more information and tutorials.

These documents have been generated using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/).

## stompjs

Preferred entry point is [Client](./classes/Client.html).
If you are using the compatibility mode, your entry point would be
[Stomp](./classes/Stomp.html).

## rx-stomp

Your entry point would be [RxStomp](./classes/RxStomp.html).
For RPC [RxStompRPC](./classes/RxStompRPC.html).
